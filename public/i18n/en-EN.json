    "longDescription": "<p>From early days in preschool choir to tormenting neighbors with his high notes, Mitch has always been possessed by music. At 15, he joined a few local bands and began training in secret, plotting sonic revenge from his bedroom.</p> <p>At 21, he finally started taking singing and guitar lessons — much to the dismay of his teachers, who eventually encouraged him to pursue his destructive solo path. In 2023, he met Francio and Echoes, bonding over a shared love of metal: power and thrash with Francio, more eclectic vibes with Echoes.</p> <p>Thus Knot Poet was born, with Mitch at the helm, ready to shatter eardrums across the globe. His motto? <strong>\"Keep the metal ALIVEEEEEEE!!\"</strong></p>"

    "description": "Guitarist and band founder, listens to records only he and the producers know about",
    "longDescription": "<p>While others watched cartoons, Francio was analyzing guitar solos and hunting down obscure vinyl. A true sound archaeologist, he founded Knot Poet with a vision: to blend poetic atmospheres with face-melting riffs.</p> <p>Known for his encyclopedic knowledge of underground metal, Francio brings power, precision, and a headbanging rhythm section that shakes walls. When he’s not playing, he’s probably digging through old forums looking for forgotten demos.</p> <p>He doesn't talk much—his riffs say it all.</p>"

    "longDescription": "<p>Raised in the silence of the mountains, Ingo's calm hides a turbulent past in the underground black metal scene. He traded frozen forests for smoke-filled rehearsal rooms—but kept the darkness in his sound.</p> <p>When he joined the Knot Poet crew, he brought eerie melodies, glacial tremolo picking, and a supernatural ability to summon storms with a single chord.</p> <p>He rarely smiles—but when he does, it’s usually after a flawlessly executed blast beat.</p>"

    "longDescription": "<p>Echoes didn’t choose the bassist life—the bassist life chose him. With fingers faster than light and a groove that can realign planets, he adds a cosmic touch to the heavy foundation of Knot Poet.</p> <p>Influenced by prog, funk, and jazz, Echoes blends styles with elegance and aggression. Legend has it that each of his slaps resonates across dimensions.</p> <p>And yes, baldness is a badge of dedication: each lost hair, a groove gained.</p>"

Known for his relentless energy and his mythical bandana, he’s the heartbeat of the band.</p> <p>He doesn’t waste time with words: his double kicks say it all. Whether in the studio or on stage, Fede unleashes pure percussive power with surgical precision.</p>"
