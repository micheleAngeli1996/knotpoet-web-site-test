              Knot Poet emerges from the depths of cosmic consciousness, weaving intricate soundscapes that blur the
              boundaries between dream and reality. Our music explores the liminal spaces where metal meets the

                  Born from a vision of transcendent heavy music, Knot Poet crafts sonic experiences that transport
                  listeners through celestial realms while maintaining the raw power and intensity that defines our
                  metallic core.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each composition is a journey through the vast expanse of human emotion, channeled through crushing
                  riffs, atmospheric passages, and otherworldly melodies that speak to the soul's deepest yearnings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our sound draws inspiration from the cosmos itself - the birth and death of stars, the silence between
                  galaxies, and the infinite dance of celestial bodies across the void.

                  Our evolution as artists has been guided by a constant quest to push beyond conventional boundaries.
                  We've incorporated elements from ambient music, post-rock, and even field recordings from space

              We believe music is a conduit for transcendence, a bridge between the physical and metaphysical realms.
